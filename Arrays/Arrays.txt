1. Student Grades and Names

-> Problem Statement:
- Objective: Develop a system to manage and display student names along with their respective grades for different subjects.
- Tasks:
  - Store student names in an array ("students").
  - Store corresponding grades in another array ("grades").
  - Print each student's name and grade.

Sample Data:
- Students: ["John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Michael Johnson"]
- Grades: [85, 92, 78]

Output:
Student: John Doe, Grade: 85
Student: Jane Smith, Grade: 92
Student: Michael Johnson, Grade: 78



2. Inventory Management

-> Problem Statement:
- Objective: Implement an inventory management system for a grocery store.
- Tasks:
  - Maintain a list of vegetable names in an array ("vegetables").
  - Keep track of quantities for each vegetable in another array ("quantities").
  - Implement operations to add new vegetables, update quantities, and remove out-of-stock items.
  - Display current inventory status.

Sample Data:
- Vegetables: ["Carrot", "Tomato", "Spinach"]
- Quantities: [50, 30, 20]

Output:
Inventory:
Carrot - Quantity: 50
Tomato - Quantity: 30
Spinach - Quantity: 20


3. Recipe Ingredients and Quantities

-> Problem Statement:
- Objective: Create a system to manage ingredients required for recipes.
- Tasks:
  - Store ingredient names in an array ("ingredients").
  - Maintain quantities needed for each ingredient in another array ("quantities").
  - Allow for adding new ingredients and updating quantities as needed.
  - Display a list of ingredients along with their current quantities.


Sample Data:
- Ingredients: ["Flour", "Sugar", "Eggs"]
- Quantities: [2, 1, 4]

Output:
Recipe Ingredients:
Flour - Quantity: 2
Sugar - Quantity: 1
Eggs - Quantity: 4


4. Event Planning and Attendees

-> Problem Statement:
- Objective: Organize attendee information for different sessions or workshops at an event.
- Tasks:
  - Create arrays to store session names ("sessions") and attendee lists ("attendees").
  - Implement functionality to add attendees to specific sessions.
  - Provide options to remove attendees who cancel their registration.
  - Display the list of attendees for each session.

Sample Data:
- Sessions: ["Workshop A", "Workshop B", "Seminar"]
- Attendees:
  [
    ["John Doe", "Jane Smith"],
    ["Michael Johnson", "Emily Brown"],
    ["David Lee"]
  ]

Output:
Workshop A:
John Doe
Jane Smith

Workshop B:
Michael Johnson
Emily Brown

Seminar:
David Lee


5. Data Filtering and Reporting

-> Problem Statement:
- Objective: Develop a tool to filter and report on specific data collected over time.
- Tasks:
  - Store collected data points in an array ("data").
  - Implement filters based on criteria such as date range or value range.
  - Calculate statistics (e.g., average, sum) on filtered data.
  - Generate reports or summaries based on the processed data.

Sample Data:
- Data Points: [120, 80, 150, 100, 200, 90, 180]

Output:
Filtered Data: [120, 150, 200, 180]
Average: 162.5


----------------------------------------------------------

Basic:

1. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.
Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
Expected Output :
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red+Green+White+Black"

2. Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.
Sample array : var arr1 = [ -3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ];
Sample Output : -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8

3. Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

4. Write a JavaScript program that prints the elements of the following array.
Note : Use nested for loops.
Sample array : var a = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
Sample Output :
"row 0"
" 1"
" 2"
" 1"
" 24"
"row 1"
------
------

5. Write a JavaScript program to flatten a nested (any depth) array. If you pass shallow, the array will only be flattened to a single level.
Sample Data :
console.log([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]]);
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
console.log([1, [2], [3, [[4]]],[5,6]], true);
[1, 2, 3, [[4]], 5, 6]
